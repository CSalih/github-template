## How to contribute

### A checklist for a good Pull Request (PR)

* Discuss first your proposed change (Use Github Discussion for a large proposals otherwise use Github Issues)
* One feature/change per PR, no changes to code not directly related to your PR
* PR rebased on main
* Include functional/integration test
* Include documentation

### 1. Discuss your propose
Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker. 
An issue for your problem might already exist and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.

Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests. 
Instead, we recommend using Github Discussion to ask any kind of questions or ideas.

### 2. Implement

Do not format or refactor code that is not directly related to your contribution. 
If you have a strong need to refactor code then submit a separate PR for the refactoring,
otherwise your PR may get rejected.

Always use the [Git Commit Convention](https://gist.github.com/CSalih/3a7762074005b25bacf95c9f9e383258) format.
Please, also provide a good description commit message, with a link to the issue. 


### 3. Submit your PR

When preparing your PR make sure you have rebased on the main branch from the project repository 
([See Git Documentation for more details](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing)).
We also require that the PR includes a linking to an issue.

Once you have submitted your PR please monitor it for comments/feedback.
